I received my Bachelor's degree from Tsinghua University in July 2014, and I am currently a Ph.D. candidate with Department of Electrical Engineering, Tsinghua University (supervised by Profs. Yonghua Song and Jin Lin).  I am also a research intern at Tencent for recommender systems, and will join Tencent after graduation.

My research interests include machine learning and optimization techniques. My Ph.D. work mainly focused on stochastic optimization techniques and their applications to electric power systems. Currently, I have been focusing more on machine learning techniques, especially online learning and recommender systems.
