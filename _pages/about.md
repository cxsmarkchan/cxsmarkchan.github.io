I am currently a senior researcher at Tencent Incorporation for recommender systems. I received my Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Tsinghua University in Jul. 2019(supervised by Profs. Yonghua Song and Jin Lin), and Bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from the same university in Jul. 2014. 

My research interests include machine learning and optimization techniques. My Ph.D. work mainly focused on stochastic optimization techniques and their applications to electric power systems. Currently, I have been focusing more on machine learning techniques, especially online learning and recommender systems.
